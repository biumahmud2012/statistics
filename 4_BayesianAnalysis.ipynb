A witness saw the accident and claimed that the cab that hit the pedestrian was a ECO cab. Tests by investigators reveal that, under similar circumstances, this witness is correctly able to identify a ECO cab 90% of the time, and correctly identify a Yellow cab 85% of the time; this means she incorrectly calls a DC cab a ECO cab 15% of the time and incorrectly calls a ECO cab a DC cab 10% of the time.\n",
